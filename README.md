# Dropped Project
This project was more of a prototype, as it was my first time at Go, it needs refactoring since I regretted not taking many things into account, like:
- In Backend:
  - The implementation of Roles & Access Controls (mainly for server roles)
  - The real-time notification system was not well designed
  - First time in any langauge will grant unwanted results in the code base (First time Go-lang)
    - Minimal test coverage, especially for edge cases
    - Poor separation of concerns in some endpoints
  - User Status in servers and rooms (channels)
      - The message read status system was too simplistic
  - Lack of proper input validation in many endpoints
  - Many inconsistencies like error handling across endpoints
  - No "robust" logging system
  - Poor naming conventions
    - I used the 'Rooms Servers' for 'Servers'
  - Maybe I should use graphQL instead of RestAPI?
  - Poor planing for API interfaces
- In Frontend:
  - Frontend state management became unwieldy as the application grew
  - Missing proper error feedback to users in the UI
  - The layout was missed up
  - I discovred that I prefer creating a whole new UI, rather than cloning an existing one (in my case Discord)
